# AVR-Simple-Calculator
This is a GitHub repo for a simple calculator project using AVR microcontroller, DIO, LCD, and keypad. The code is in C language, well-organized, and commented. LCD shows input and calculation results, while the keypad provides user input. Ideal for learning microcontroller programming and external component interfacing. Contributions welcome.

# Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need an AVR microcontroller, an LCD display, and a keypad. You can find the schematics for connecting these components in the schematics directory. Once you have connected the components, you can compile and upload the code to the microcontroller using your preferred programming software.

# Usage
To use the calculator, simply enter the numbers and operations using the keypad. The LCD display will show the input and the result of the calculation. The supported operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

# Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome! If you find any bugs or want to add new features, feel free to submit a pull request. Before submitting, please make sure to test your changes thoroughly and follow the code formatting and commenting conventions.
